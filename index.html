      <p>In his early game development career, some time between 1987 and 1988, Sega partnered with a Japanese magazine named "Beep!" on a "Story Recruitment Campaign" for the then-upcoming Phantasy Star II, allowing the general population to submit ideas to be considered for the game (contrary to the contest name, any idea was fair game, and not just story concepts). Over 2000 submissions were made, and Sega awarded 29 winners with individually numbered "Associate Planner" certificates and the opportunity to meet with the Phantasy Star II development team at a planning meeting at their headquarters - one of whom was a 17-year-old Masahiro Sakurai. Sakurai specifically won the "Game System Award" (with his certificate being numbered 004) for what he described as a battle system concept that was "something like the action-focused Active Time Battle system seen in JRPGs." Sakurai attended the planning meeting and would later use his award to advance his professional image, eventually leading to HAL Laboratory hiring him at the age of 18 once he graduated from high school.</p>
